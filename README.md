It is just doing some stuff intelligently. It has the following features:
- Chat, powered by [Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-VL-Chat) (ÈÄö‰πâÂçÉÈóÆ).
- Text-To-Speech, powered by [Azure AI Speech](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-speech).

## Installation

```bash
pip install shirley
```

## Quick tour

```python
# webui.py

import gradio as gr
import shirley as sh

with gr.Blocks() as blocks:
    sh.interfaces.Header()
    with gr.Tab('Chat'):
        sh.interfaces.Chat()
    with gr.Tab('Text-To-Speech'):
        sh.interfaces.TextToSpeech()
    sh.interfaces.Footer()

blocks.queue().launch()
```

Note: I made a working [example](https://github.com/luojiahai/shirley/blob/main/webui.py). You can use that.

### Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python webui.py
```

Note: I recommend using [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies and run Python. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for more details.
